 * @param {*} index_num Specifies which value argument is selected. Index_num must be a number between 1 and 254, or a formula or reference to a value containing a number between 1 and 254. If index_num is 1, CHOOSE returns value1; if it is 2, CHOOSE returns value2; and so on. If index_num is less than 1 or greater than the number of the last value in the list, CHOOSE returns the #VALUE! error value. If index_num is a fraction, it is truncated to the lowest integer before being used.
 - If index_num is 1, CHOOSE returns value1; if it is 2, CHOOSE returns value2; and so on.
 - If index_num is less than 1 or greater than the number of the last value in the list, CHOOSE returns the #VALUE! error value.
 - If index_num is a fraction, it is truncated to the lowest integer before being used.
 * @param {*} args value1, value2, ... Value 1 is required, subsequent values are optional. 1 to 254 value arguments from which CHOOSE selects a value or an action to perform based on index_num. The arguments can be numbers, value references, defined names, formulas, functions, or text.

 * @param {*} row_index_num The row number in table_array from which the matching value will be returned. A row_index_num of 1 returns the first row value in table_array, a row_index_num of 2 returns the second row value in table_array, and so on.

The difference is that HLOOKUP searches for the value of lookup_value in the first row, VLOOKUP searches in the first column, and LOOKUP searches according to the dimensions of array.
